# Arithmetic Logic Unit

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a fundamental component of the CPU (Central Processing Unit) that performs arithmetic and logic operations. The design of the ALU in this project encompasses:

Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Logic Operations: AND, OR, NOT, XOR.
Shift Operations: Logical and arithmetic shifts, both left and right.
This ALU is designed to be efficient and flexible, capable of handling a variety of data sizes and operation types. It plays a crucial role in the overall functioning of the processor by executing the core computational tasks required by programs.

Our implementation ensures optimized performance and reliability, making it a key component in the RISC-V architecture we are developing.
This project is created by Vivek Kumar and Vatsalya singh.
